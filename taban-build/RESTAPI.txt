Taban uses a HTTP based REST API and assumes the following mappings to traditional CRUD
operations and HTTP methods:

PUT - Create or Update by sending the entire document
GET - Read a document
DELETE - Delete a document
POST - reserved for special actions

The HTTP GET method will return a JSON array of child URIs if the URI ends with a trailing slash.  
This can be limited with the headers 'taban_start' (zero indexed, inclusive) and 'taban_limit'.  For 
example:

GET /taban/countries/ 
[
  "UK",
  "USA",
  "Greece",
  "Italy",
  "Spain",
  "Germany",
  "France",
  "Holland",
  "Afghanistan",
  "Iran",
  "Iraq"
]

GET /taban/countries/
taban_start: 4
[
  "Italy",
  "Spain",
  "Germany",
  "France",
  "Holland",
  "Afghanistan",
  "Iran",
  "Iraq"
]

GET /taban/countries/
taban_limit: 3
[
  "UK",
  "USA",
  "Greece"
]

GET /taban/countries/
taban_start: 4
taban_limit: 2
[
  "Spain",
  "Germany"
]

If any of the children had children of their own, they would appear multiple times in the results, 
but ending with a forward slash in order to indicate that there is content available at that 
location.  For example, this example shows that the UK has content and children, whereas 
France and UK only has children, the other countries only having content:

GET /taban/countries/ 
[
  "UK",
  "UK/",
  "USA",
  "Greece",
  "Italy",
  "Spain",
  "Germany",
  "France/",
  "Holland",
  "Afghanistan",
  "Iran",
  "Iraq"
]

Searching for particular children JSON documents can be achieved with one or more taban_query 
headers.  For example:

GET /taban/countries/
taban_query: "population"."size" > "300000000"
[
  "USA"
]

GET /taban/countries/
taban_query: "population"."size" < "100000000"
taban_query: "language" = "English"
[
  "UK"
]

Note that query headers are implicitly logical ANDs.  For 'OR' style queries, it is recommended to 
run multiple queries and merge the results manually.

It is also possible to force the contents of the documents at the URIs returned above to be included in
the results using the 'include' header.  For instance:

GET /taban/countries/
taban_query: "language" = "English"
taban_limit: 3
taban_include: true
[
  "UK" : {
  	"population" : {
  		"size": 60943912
  	},
  	"language" : "English"
  },
  "USA" : {
  	"population" : {
  		"size": 304059724
  	},
  	"language" : "English"
  }
]

When a resource is requested without a trailing slash the HTTP GET method returns the JSON document at that 
location, if it exists.  For example:

GET /taban/countries/USA
{
  "population" : {
	"size" : 304059724
  },
  "language" : "English"
}

When storing data there are two methods which both use the HTTP PUT method.  

When putting a JSON document in to a URI that ends with a trailing slash, an ID is automatically 
generated and returned in the 'taban_autoid' header of the HTTP response.  The type of ID
generated is determined by the ID generator service (see /README.txt).

When putting a JSON document in to a URL without a trailing slash the supplied JSON document 
replaces any existing content at that location, but will not affect any 'children' that might 
exist.

In the case of PUT and DELETE it is possible to retrieve the contents previously at those 
locations by specifying the header "taban_previous: true".
